The Group has a total customer base of 285 million customers worldwide at 30 June 2024, including 246 million mobile customers and 21 million fixed broadband customers. These figures have been restated to account for the deconsolidation of certain activities in Spain following the creation of MASORANGE. The Group is present in 26 countries (including non-consolidated countries).
              Orange is also a leading provider of global IT and telecommunication services to multinational companies under the brand Orange Business. In February 2023, the Group presented its strategic plan 'Lead the Future', built on a new business model and guided by responsibility and efficiency.

It was established to act as the English Government's banker, and is still the banker for HM Government. The Bank was privately owned by stockholders from its foundation in 1694 until nationalized in 1946. In 1998, it became an independent public organization, wholly owned by the Treasury Solicitor on behalf of the government, with independence in setting monetary policy. The Bank is one of eight banks authorized to issue banknotes in the United Kingdom, but has a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in England and Wales and regulates the issue of banknotes by commercial banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland. They are headquartered in London, England.

            description: The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is a private research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Founded in 1861 in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. Researchers worked on computers, radar, and inertial guidance during World War II and the Cold War. Post-war defense research contributed to the rapid expansion of the faculty and campus under James Killian. The current 168-acre (68.0 ha) campus opened in 1916 and extends over 1 mile (1.6 km) along the northern bank of the Charles River basin. The Institute is traditionally known for its research and education in the physical sciences and engineering, and more recently in biology, economics, linguistics, and management as well. It is often cited as among the world's top universities. The "Engineers" sponsor 31 sports, most teams of which compete in the NCAA Division III's New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference; the Division I rowing programs compete as part of the EARC and EAWRC.

              Organizations joining the EUDI Wallet ecosystem face a tough choice: patch together protocol libraries that may not exist for their stack, or rely on proprietary solutions that risk vendor lock-in.

              EUDIPLO solves this by providing a lightweight, source-available, protocol abstraction layer. It communicates over HTTP and integrates easily with your existing backend stack—so you can focus on your business logic, not cryptographic plumbing.

              It supports all core flows of electronic attribute attestations—issuing, requesting, and even requesting during issuance—and is already compatible with production-grade EUDI Wallets like Animo.

              While still in early development, EUDIPLO is built for production: secure key management, scalable database support, and clean API boundaries.

            description: IronCore provides the new reference for compounded software layers for inventorying, managing, and maintaining Baremetal using Kubernetes’ cloud-native principles. Kubernetes, originally designed to manage and orchestrate containerized applications and microservices, has significantly expanded its reach through its inherent API extensibility, allowing it to be adapted to a wide range of use cases entirely outside the realm of containers. IronCore takes a modern spin with Kubernetes, offering a single interface for managing resources orchestrated across regions, data centers, and availability zones. All assembled with the identical blueprint, thereby offering unmatched flexibility, scalability, and ease of use. Unlike traditional infrastructure solutions, IronCore delivers a much sought, fresh, next generation approach. As a default, Ceph is modularly provided as a cloud-natively automated, vendor-neutral storage backend for block, shared, and object storage. Furthermore, a disruptive network fabric based on CLOS Topology is included. The software defined network data plane materializes through routed layer 3 only, using an IPv6 overlay, and is grounded on the robust, standard experience of the established internet architecture and technology.

              Open Crypto Broker (OCB) introduces an abstraction layer where cryptographic operations are defined through configurable profiles rather than being hardcoded into applications. Instead of applications handling their own cryptographic functions, they can rely on OCB to manage these tasks. This separation of concerns enables organizations to meet new security requirements, such as compliance with FIPS 140 or the transition to Post-Quantum Cryptography, without needing to modify the underlying applications.

              VCX is an open-source codebase that provides a wide suite of Rust modules for building DID & Aries-related applications (client/mobile and server). VCX is designed with a heavily modularized structure (20+ crates in the workspace) such that consumers can pick-and-choose which components they wish to build their DI application with. Currently, some of the significant modules provided by VCX include:
              * `did_doc`, `did_parser`, `did_resolver` - a set of lightweight libraries which provide well-typed structures and interfaces for DID building, parsing, and resolving. We envision these components becoming defacto libraries for Rust projects involving DIDs.
              * DID Method Crates - several DID method-specific crates for resolving and managing DIDs (peer, cheqd, web, key, jwk, sov/unqualified).
              * `aries_vcx_ledger`, `aries_vcx_wallet`, `aries_vcx_anoncreds` - a set of libraries with interfaces for performing ledger, wallet, and anoncred operations involved in Aries protocols. Includes implementations for Indy & Cheqd ledgers (i.e. resolving anoncreds objects), Askar wallets, and anoncreds-rs.
              * `messages` - well-typed library for building and parsing Aries (DIDComm V1) messages
              * `aries_vcx` - Implementation of Aries protocol state machines, which provide APIs to step through Aries protocols, utilizing lots of the above-mentioned modules. Currently mostly for AIP1 protocols, but some AIP2 protocols such as DIDExchange/OOB.
